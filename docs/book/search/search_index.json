Simply connect sensor or actuator you want to, join the board to IQRF network and device is ready. If you are satisfied with such working device scale IQRFBB-10 layout to final product and your IOT product is done. In this tutorial we will show you: How to prepare IQRF network. How to connect IQRFBB-10 to the IQRF network as a node. How to connect different sensors to the board. How to communicate with the board from your software via IQRF gateway. Prepare IQRF network Firs check IQRF network around you. If you do not have any, let's start with this tutorial SetupIqrfNetwork . Assemble Board JP1: OFF JP6: OFF Insert IQRF TR into board Connect Programmer Unplug USB cable from CK-USB-04A Unplug IQRFBB-10 from microUSB and JP6=OFF. Unplug TR module JP1=OFF. Make wiring Plug JP4=ON, JP1=OFF. Plug micro-USB to IQRFBB-10 to power-on. Indication LD1=ON (charging battery), LD4=ON Plug micro-USB to CK-USB-04A Now the board is ready for software loading Load Software If we are talking about software loading, we always mean loading software to IQRF transceiver TR-76D mounted on IQRFBB-10. Via software load you configure transceiver within IQRF network. Now we will configure board (transceiver) as a node of IQRF network. Make sure you made a proper wiring and both USB power sources (programmer + board) are on. Now you can upload node configuration as described in preparation of your IQRF network chapter . Do not put any IQRF module into CK-USB-04A programmer SIM! Uploading data into transciever is sihnalized by LD3 diod on IQRFBB-10 board. Unplug micro USB of CK-USB-04A programmer Unplug micro USB of IQRFBB-10 board. Unplug CK-USB-04A from IQRFBB-10. Bond to Network Bonding IQRF nodes is generally described here... , bonding IQRFBB-10 board goes this way: Turn on battery power JP6 = ON . Diod indicating power on is LD4 = ON . Turn TR module power JP1 = ON . Open IDE, then menu start Tools/IQMESH Network Manager and fill out the dialogue as shown (TX power, Auto address, ...). Then pres Clear All Bonds for remove any previous bonded modules. Red diods of modules are blinking, at IQRFBB-10 it is diod LD3 . Then pres Bond Node and during bonding period press and hold SW1 button at one node until green diod turns on. Repeat for each node. At IQRFBB-10 the SW1 is an external contact EQ12, GND , red diod is LD3 and green diods is LD2 . Now you should see yellow spots indicating successful bonding. Now click Discovery and spots are in blue. Switch in IDE to Map View and you should see node structure something like in the picture. Try to turn on LD3 (RED diod) on IQRFBB-10 board. Click rigt mouse button on spot indicating board (it depends on the bonding order) and select LED Red On . Then the LD3 = ON on the board. Check Operability Now you have fully configured IQRFBB-10 board. You can check operability this way: Battery power turn on/off is always done via JP6 . When you power board on, then it is always automatically connected to the IQRF network (if you properly did all steps above). For checking of connectivity open IDE and in IQMESH Network Manager , view Control click Discovery button. Working nodes are displayed in blue spots, previously bonded but inactive are shown as yellow spots. Switch to Map View , find IQRF-BB10 node (one of blue spheres) and try to turn on LD3 (RED diod) on IQRFBB-10 board. Right click mouse button on spot indicating board and select LED Red On . Then the LD3 = ON on the board. Examples Now we can make from IQRFBB-10 any wireless sensor or actuator by wiring proper sensor or actuators.

Simply said IQRF network is mesh kind of network working very well indoor and outdoor (up to 500m). It has one device as concentrator connected to gateway or your PC and the rest of devices are wireless nodes . The best start with IQRF is with their DS-START-04 development kit. It helps you to create your first IQRF network for testing purposes. In this tutorial we will show you how to create IQRF network with this kit. Install IDE IDE is a basic programming tool for IQRF devices. Download and install https://www.iqrf.org/technology/iqrf-ide/iqrf-ide-gui Install IQRF Startup Package Download IQRF Startup package and unpack anywhere to your hard drive. First Start Start your IDE, navigate to your installed IQRF Startup package e.g. d:\\IQRF_OS403_7xD\\Examples\\DPA\\StartUp and open HWP-demo.iqrfprj Insert any IQRF module to programmer CK-USB-04A and connect to PC via USB. In IDE you will probably see USB device not connected in bottom panel. Go to menu Tools/USB Classes/Swith to Custom Device mode and select listed COM (USB) port. If you do not see any port please follow troubleshooting on IQRF support. You need driver update. Successful selection will show dialogue like this. Click Switch and the bottom panel will show Module ready - communication mode It might show dialogue about firmware update, then click Yes . Click Upload button, wait for firmware update, then press Close . Configure Coordinator A Concentrator is the node connected with PC or Gateway gathering data from all nodes. ! When you insert or remove TR from holder, always press SW2 button (nearer to SIM slot). It breaks power. In left panel check HWP-Coordinator-...iqrf file Double click on DPA-config.xml in left panel. Set items in dialogue as picture shows and click Upload button. In menu select Programming/Upload/Upload Selected Items . If the system complains that uploading version is not for the connected TR module, please upgrade OS in module. See Upgrade OS in TR module section. Configure Nodes A Node is a module communication within mesh with Concentrator. ! When you insert or remove TR from holder, always press SW2 button (nearer to SIM slot). It breaks power. Insert TR module to be node into programmer In left panel of IDE check HWP-Node-STD-... Keep the DPA-config.xml settings as previously at concentrator. Upload all your nodes. If the system complains that uploading version is not for the connected TR module, please upgrade OS in module. See Upgrade OS in TR module section. Upgrade OS in modules In menu select Tools/Change IQRF OS Wizard and follow wizard. Use SPI as upload method. Then select version to be uploaded !If your modules are older you might need to repeat the upgrade OS more times Run Network Insert coordinator configured TR module to programmer CK-USB-04A and nodes to other DK-EVAL-04A modules. In IDE in menu start Tools/IQMESH Network Manager and fill out the dialogue as shown (TX power, Auto address, ...). Then pres Clear All Bonds for remove any previous bonded modules. Red diods of modules are blinking. Then pres Bond Node and during bonding period press and hold SW1 button at one node until green red turns on. Repeat for each node. Now you should see two spots indicating successful bonding. Now click Discovery and spots are in blue. Switch in IDE to Map View and you should see node structure Click right mouse button on node 1 and select LED Red On Now you can see that the RED LED of node 1 is on. In similar way you can turn-off or play with LEDs. Send DPA messages Direct Peripheral Access (DPA) protocol is a simple byte-oriented protocol used to control nodes and network. Detail description of DPA Framework DPA can be sent via IDE. Open Terminal and click Set LEDR on which prefills data into Data to send fields. Change only NADR=0001 which indicates node 1 and click Send . This DPA command turned on RED diod on node 1. You can define any other DPA messages. Load Custom DPA Handler Custom DPA Handler is software routine which is executed within transceiver MCU and where you can put your customer code to modify. In IDE Project window you can see actually loaded CustomDpaHandler under Source item. Under Output HEX is its compiled code. You can click right mouse button above source of CustomDpaHandler-.. file and choose Build from menu for rebuilding of handler. You can load any other Custom DPA Handler from prepared set in IQRF SDK here: ./IQRF_OS403_7xD/Examples/DPA/CustomDpaHandlerExamples or you can modify any or write your own. Note: When you create your own handler, put it into CustomDpaHandlerExamples folder to be available others IQRF header files. Adding of your Custom DPA Handler: Right-click on any existing Custom DPA Handler under Source . From context menu select Add/Add Existing Item and select your CustomDpaHandler.c file. Make sure your handler is selected and via right-click select Build for its rebuild. You will see its compiled .hex state under Output Hex item. Right-click on the .hex file and select Upload . Now the handler will be uploaded to TR module. Then double-click on DPA-config.xml and in dialogue tick Custom DPA Handler and then Upload . Your own IQRF devices Now it's time to build your own IQRF device.
