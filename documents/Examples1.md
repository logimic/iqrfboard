# Standard Things

Standard things have pre-defined JSON API and all IQRF gateways know them.  If you implement your device in TR module as **Standard Light**, **Standard Binary Output**, **Standard Sensor** and more you have ensured compatibility of your device with IOT world.

## 1. Standard Light
![](files/images/iqrfboard_120x100.png)

This example shows how to create "Standard light" from your board which means that entire world will know that your device is just a light and will be able to manage it (turn on/off, dim, get status and more). Your hardware design on the top of board is not limited.
